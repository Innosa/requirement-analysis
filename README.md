# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is a guide to document the concepts, techniques, and deliverables associated with requirement analysis in booking app software development. It aims to provide clear explanations of requirement-gathering processes, acceptance criteria, stakeholder communication practices, and templates for common analysis artifacts (use cases, user stories, acceptance criteria). The purpose is to serve as a concise reference and working space for developers, product managers, business analysts, and QA engineers.


# What is Requirement Analysis?
The Requirement Analysis in Software Engineering is all about understanding what software is meant to do and the extent to which it will cover or how it should perform.
This Requirement Analysis is a phase toward product development and it usually involves the technical process and team effort, where stakeholders and developers determine what is needful and the condition the new product must meet, by analysing, documenting and identifying features of this product requirement for clarity and feasibility for both stakeholders and software developers. This is crucial because it cuts off costly mistakes.

## Importance of Requirement Analysis
The requirement analysis is important for;
#Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
#Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
#Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
#Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
#Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. Requirement Gathering 
Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
Surveys/Questionnaires: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
Workshops: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
Observation: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.
2. Requirement Elicitation
Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
Focus Groups: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.
3. Requirement Documentation 
Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the userâ€™s perspective.
Use Cases: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.
4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Requirement Prioritization: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
Modeling: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.
5. Requirement Validation 
Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.


# Types of Requirements
Functional Requirements are the criteria of what the system should do. Like the reference site for system design apps for hotel booking. 
Examples for Functional Requirement are; Hotel Management service, Customer service (search and booking) and View booking service. 
Non-Functional Requirements refer to how the system should perform. Examples are: balance loader, service cluster, database cluster, massaging queue system(kafta and rabbitMQ), Elastic search, Cassandra and Hadoop.
