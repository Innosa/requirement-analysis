# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is a guide to document the concepts, techniques, and deliverables associated with requirement analysis in booking app software development. It aims to provide clear explanations of requirement-gathering processes, acceptance criteria, stakeholder communication practices, and templates for common analysis artifacts (use cases, user stories, acceptance criteria). The purpose is to serve as a concise reference and working space for developers, product managers, business analysts, and QA engineers.


# What is Requirement Analysis?
The Requirement Analysis in Software Engineering is all about understanding what software is meant to do and the extent to which it will cover or how it should perform.
This Requirement Analysis is a phase toward product development and it usually involves the technical process and team effort, where stakeholders and developers determine what is needful and the condition the new product must meet, by analysing, documenting and identifying features of this product requirement for clarity and feasibility for both stakeholders and software developers. This is crucial because it cuts off costly mistakes.

## Importance of Requirement Analysis
The requirement analysis is important for;
#Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
#Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
#Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
#Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
#Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
